Django's application to serve up-to-date common static files (JQuery, Bootstrap, Plugins, ...) as "base" static directory

---

## Requirements

These packages are required:

* Python (3.8+)
* Django (3.2+)

We **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.


## Installation

1. Install using `pip`, including any optional packages you want...

    ``` shell
    pip install django-static-base
    ```

    ...or clone the project from github.

    ``` shell
    git clone https://github.com/DLRSP/django-static-base/
    ```

2. Add `'static_base'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

    ``` python title="settings.py"
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...other apps
        "static_base"
    ]
    ```

3. Add the following pre-requisites to your `base.html` template

    ``` html title="base.html"
    <html>
    <head>
    ...
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'base/css/bootstrap.css' %}">
    ...
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'base/js/jquery.min.js' %}"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'base/js/bootstrap.min.js' %}"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'base/js/plugins/lazysizes.min.js' %}" async></script>
    ...
      <script type="module" src="{% static 'base/js/plugins/instantpage.min.js' %}" defer></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

4. Add all your needed plugins or customization to your `base.html` template or sub-templates used by your project

    ``` html title="base.html"
    <html>
    <head>
    ...
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'base/css/plugins/jquery.smartmenus.bootstrap-4.css' %}">
    ...
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'base/css/style-btn.css' %}">
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'base/css/color/blue.css' %}">
    ...
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'base/css/custom.css' %}">
    ...
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'base/js/jquery.min.js' %}"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'base/js/bootstrap.min.js' %}"></script>
    ...
      <script type="module" src="{% static 'base/js/plugins/instantpage.min.js' %}" defer></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
